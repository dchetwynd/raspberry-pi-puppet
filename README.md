This repo is for provisioning a Raspberry Pi device using Puppet. It assumes that the Raspberry Pi already has a fresh copy of the Raspbian OS installed on its SD card. The Puppet manifest is for provisioning my own personal machine configuration, which includes:

vimrc file\n
bashrc file\n
installing git\n
.gitconfig file with custom git aliases and helper functions\n
my public SSH key\n
vncserver running on boot for remote desktop into the Raspberry Pi\n


This Puppet manifest was created at the 16/11/2013 meeting of the Manchester Raspberry Jam user group at Madlab
